# PCS Chair Colorizer

This add-on enables you to choose an alternative color to emphasize the documents you are managing as an Associate Chair on the PCS Chair ([pcschair.org](https://pcschair.org)) platform. By using a color picker, you can tailor the color to suit your tastes, which is particularly useful for improving accessibility to the list. This extension is not an official tool but rather a contribution from the community.
